In the about a year that I got to be his senior, I was consistently impressed with his ability to take on new tasks and also know the right questions to ask to find the best possible solution to any problem. He is a quick learner who I never needed to follow up on any task with as he followed up proactively with me when he ran into any issues. Overall, I think Garrett would be an excellent addition to any team or solo situation and I would be comfortable providing my recommendation for him for any position.”",

I worked with Garrett on a fully-remote team, where he joined us as a contracted full stack engineer but was quickly hired as a full-time software engineer. \n\n From day one with the team, Garrett hit the ground running by leveraging his existing expertise to rapidly familiarize himself with our code base and niche libraries. Within a remarkably short period of time, Garrett was already creating pull-requests and generating value for the team. During collaboration meetings and code-reviews, Garrett always offers valuable insights and contributions. I have found that he is one of the few engineers that I have met that have an intuitive sense for UI/UX considerations. Additionally, communicating with Garrett is always easy - he is friendly, charismatic, and, on the rare occasions where I have given him feedback, he is extremely receptive of guidance.\n Garrett is, without a doubt, a high-performer. He has a proven track record to produce a high amount of output without sacrificing quality - Garrett has a knack for writing clean code that is coupled with robust logic. Additionally, he's proven himself to be extremely adaptable by learning React Native on the fly, without any formal training or instruction, and taking ownership of all maintenance and enhancements for our team's mobile application. \n”",
